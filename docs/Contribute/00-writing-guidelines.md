# Writing guidelines

To ensure consistency across all pages, we will need to clarify the following points:

- Generally, you can make use of all common markdown practices.
- **Use of mathematical notation**: Prefer $\LaTeX$-style formulas for clarity and precision, supported by MathJax.
- **Scientific conventions**: Since we can't enforce coherent use of notation throughout all documents, please always introduce non-trivial notation conventions in your document -- either prior to the usage or as a foot note.
- **Code snippets**: Highlight code properly using fenced code blocks with language identifiers for syntax highlighting or preferably use pseudocode according to our [pseudo code conventions](01-pseudocode-conventions.md).
- **Citations and references**: Use **a** standard format for referencing external sources or resources.
- **Images and diagrams**: Use descriptive captions and ensure all visuals are clear and properly referenced.
- **Language and tone**: Maintain a formal and pedagogical style suitable for students. Do not use notation or make statements, that are not defined prior in your or another document. In the latter case, please refer to the underlying document. **Use Great Britain spelling**. It's self-explanatory that your texts should be free of spelling- or grammar mistakes. Subliminal mistakes are of course okay, but we want to maintain a certain level of professionalism.
- **How to contribute**: If you intend to contribute, please send a request to [contribute@project-arctic.science](mailto:contribute@arctic-project.science).
