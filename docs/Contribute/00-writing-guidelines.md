# Writing guidelines

To ensure consistency across all pages, we will need to clarify the following points:

- Generally, you can make use of all common markdown practices.
- **Use of mathematical notation**: Prefer $\LaTeX$-style formulas for clarity and precision, supported by MathJax.
- **Scientific conventions**: Since we can't enforce coherent use of notation throughout all documents, please always introduce non-trivial notation conventions in your document -- either prior to the usage or as a foot note.
- **Code snippets**: Highlight code properly using fenced code blocks with language identifiers for syntax highlighting or preferably use pseudocode according to our [pseudo code conventions](01-pseudocode-conventions.md).
- **Markdown and $\LaTeX$ Convention**: For each sentence, use one line in the code.
Visual linebreaks are achievable through a double space at the end of your sentence or an empty line.
- **Citations and references**: Use **a** standard format for referencing external sources or resources.
- **Images and diagrams**: Use descriptive captions and ensure all visuals are clear and properly referenced.
Only use images if necessary, otherwise resort to `mermaid` or other compatible diagram tools to keep a uniform and global styling.
If you need another _material_-compatible extension, let us know via the email below.
- **Script structure**: For detailed guidelines on the structure of a student script, please refer to [script structure](02-script-structure.md).
- **Test exam structure**: For detailed guidelines on the structure of a text exam, please refer to .
Also, please follow the guidelines of the [script structure](02-script-structure.md).
- **Language and tone**: Maintain a formal and pedagogical style suitable for students. Do not use notation or make statements, that are not defined prior in your or another document. In the latter case, please refer to the underlying document. **Use Great Britain spelling**. It's self-explanatory that your texts should be free of spelling- or grammar mistakes. Subliminal mistakes are of course okay, but we want to maintain a certain level of professionalism.
- **Add some sort of metadata**: Make sure to include your name and the last edit date to your contributions, i.e. like this (and using dates in the _ISO 8601_ standard):

```

```
