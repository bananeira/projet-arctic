# Academic Resources Collective for Theoretical Informatics

ARCTIc is a collaborative platform dedicated to collecting and sharing academic resources in the field of Theoretical Informatics.
It serves as a growing repository of student-written lecture notes, study guides, and key concepts related to the fundamentals of formal methods, algorithms, automata, complexity, and related topics.
Additionally, it aims to compile and regularly update a collection of past exam questions, practice tasks, and solutions to support exam preparation.

The goal is to create an evolving resource that fosters learning, collaboration, and academic success among students, continuously expanding with new materials and insights.
